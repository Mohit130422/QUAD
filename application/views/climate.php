                <p>Quad partners are working together to address climate change and support regional partners, in particular the countries in the Indo-Pacific. They are collaborating on sustainable consumption and production, clean hydrogen, disaster risk management, exchanging climate information, green shipping and ports, and capacity building. At the 2023 Leaders’ Summit, the Clean Energy Supply Chains Initiative was announced to facilitate research and development and support energy transition in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad Principles of Clean Energy Supply Chains were released to guide engagement with the region on clean energy supply chain development. </p>
                <p>The Climate Information Services Taskforce, as part of the Quad Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Package (Q-CHAMP), is working to increase access to early warning systems and climate data through infrastructure and capacity building in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
