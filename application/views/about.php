                <p>Quad brings together four countries -  Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, with a commitment to work as a force for global good and to support an open, free, and inclusive Indo-pacific that is prosperous and resilient.</p>
                <p>Quad came together for the first time during the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean region to coordinate response and assistance to countries in the region. The first meeting of Quad officials took place in May 2007. Meetings of senior officials have been held on a regular basis since November 2017. Quad was elevated to the Leaders’ level in 2021.</p>

                <p>On 20 May 2023, the Quad Leaders laid out their vision for a region that is peaceful and prosperous, stable and secure, and respectful of sovereignty – free from intimidation and coercion, and where disputes are settled in accordance with international law. They committed to the following principles to respond to the challenges ahead:</p> 
                <ol>
                    <li> We are deeply invested in the future prosperity and stability of the Indo-Pacific, and are committed to bringing enduring benefit to the region by providing options that build resilience, open communication and economic growth.</li>
                    <li> We seek to maintain and strengthen stability in the Indo-Pacific where competition is managed responsibly, in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Charter, and we will work to strengthen and reform the multilateral system to ensure all nations, large and small, continue to have a voice. We seek to uphold the international order based on the rule of law.</li>
                    <li> We acknowledge and respect the centrality, agency, and leadership of regional institutions, including ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association, and will work in and alongside them to complement their efforts and advance our shared interests.</li>
                    <li> We will work transparently and in open dialogue to implement a practical agenda that delivers sustained economic and social value, is responsive to regional partners, and contributes to global priorities by advancing the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals, noting the transformational power of technology to help meet these goals.</p></li>
