                <p>Quad is working to strengthen supply chain resilience and improve the region’s digital connectivity through access to critical and emerging technologies and advanced telecommunications technology, including 5G networks. At the 2023 Leaders’ Summit, the Leaders announced Quad support for an Open RAN pilot in Palau to support the diversification and security of telecom networks, the first in the Pacific. They also launched the Quad Investors’ Network (QUIN) as a private sector-led platform to facilitate investments in strategic technologies. The Quad also published a Statement of Principles on Critical and Emerging Technology Standards, outlining its common vision for international technology standards, underpinned by values such as transparency, openness, security, and interoperability. The transformative power of technology, including digital public infrastructure, to support sustainable development in the Indo-Pacific and deliver economic and social benefits has also been recognized by Quad Leaders.</p>
